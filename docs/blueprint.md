## Core Features:

- Input Form: Provide a form-based interface to input job parameters, including emr_cluster, job_name, and main_application_file.
- JSON Generation: Dynamically generate the JSON payload based on user inputs.
- Payload Download: Allow users to download the generated JSON payload as a .json file.

- Secondary color: Use light gray (#F0F0F0) for the input form background.
- Accent: Use Green (#228B22) for buttons, specifically call to action (CTA) buttons.
- Use a clean and organized layout to present input forms and the generated JSON.
- Ensure responsiveness, so the web app looks good on different screen sizes.
